Term Project.R
There are several variables that one can consider when performing analysis on incarceration rates. For example, many are interested in understanding recidivism and its impacts; others may want to analyze total prison populations. In this research we choose to analyze the number of prison admissions across a period of 10 years: 2013 through 2022.![image](https://github.com/saldiii/CIS663-22-FA23/assets/152224467/24743f1a-f83d-42ce-b417-988b4539c5b0)
